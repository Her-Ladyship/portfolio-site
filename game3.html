            <h3>System Requirements</h3>
            <p>Potato.</p>
            <p>If NOT potato is available, turnip is sufficient, but undesirable.</p>
            <p>If negative turnip quantity, give up.</p>

            <h3>Developer Notes</h3>
            <p><strong>Sonder: Reflections</strong> is what happens when you start off with a great idea and a small but dedicated team, and then things swell and change and become something else.</p>
            <p>The project was originally a three-person collaboration, but the ink was barely dry on the contracts before the team had grown to six. That was a little bit of a logistical hiccup, but roles were soon assigned to each team member and all seemed to be going well.</p>
            <p>I was responsible for writing the dialogue, and sourcing voice actors who would lend their talents to the project for free. Luckily, I know a lot of extroverts who jumped at the chance at being involved in voicing a computer game character.</p>
            <p>I soon found that even with only a five-string dialogue tree, I'd have to write 163 lines (94 for the driver and 69 for the customer), and it didn't feel right asking anyone to do that much work with no payment, so I took over taxi driving duties.</p>
            <p>The plan was to have multiple customers in this game slice, but we very quickly realised the sheer amount of work that would be and scaled it back to just one. Better to show off things at their best than spread ourselves too thin.</p>
            <p>I am really happy with what we've produced here though - I think it's a nicely polished snapshot of what the game could build into in the future.</p>

            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>If you placed every taxi in the world end to end you'd have a lot of angry taxi drivers.</p>
