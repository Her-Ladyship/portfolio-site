            <h3>Developer Notes</h3>
            <p>This game was the second to be made in year two of my course, the second in the Godot engine, and one of the first times I'd gone into the process with clear thoughts of what I wanted to end up with.</p>
            <p>The idea was essentially Pong, but gradually getting more and more complex as the levels progressed. I thought it would be a good test of my skills with behind the scenes mechanics, and I reckoned that by now I had enough experience with Godot to try it out.</p>
            <p>The process was relatively straight-forward - I got menus, settings and level structure set up at the beginning of the project (having learned my lessons from the last one). After that, I pulled from a few tutorials on how to create a basic Pong game and set up the base level.</p>
            <p>Then for the fun part. There are levels where either the paddle speed or the ball speed has changed, one with reversed controls, one with an intermittently invisible paddle... If this project had a longer timeframe, I would have really enjoyed coming up with more ways to mess with the mechanics of what is quite a simple game, to see how far it can be pushed.</p>
            <p>As ever in these mini-projects, there are still finishing touches that don't exist yet in the game slice; I'm really pleased with the sound effects, but then again there is no music to speak of. However, almost everything missing from the game could be implemented relatively easily alongside what's already there.</p>

            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>The game of tennis was invented in Liverpool in 1841 by sir Reginald Tennis when he was banned from his local badminton club for '<strong>lewd behaviour</strong>'.</p>
