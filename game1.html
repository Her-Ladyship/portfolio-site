            <h3>Developer Notes</h3>
            <p>This was the first game of my second year, my first time using Godot, and a solo project. I may have just seen <strong>Wicked</strong> when I was looking for inspiration.</p>
            <p>I started by knocking up a simple side-scrolling platformer following a YouTube tutorial, and when that was looking good I started on my own version. This was all going swimmingly until...</p>
            <p>I realised I'd built everything within a single level structure.</p>
            <p>And since I was still getting to grips with the engine, I didn't have the skills to re-package what I had into a workable level system. So I started again, first by building a main menu interface, and then a level loading system in Godot script.</p>
            <p>Looking back at it with more experience, the level loading system I had created was complete overkill for the project, but gave me a lot of valuable insights into the less surface-level workings of the Godot engine.</p>
            <p>Then I quickly rebuilt the level I'd designed before (with a few tweaks here and there), and added a second because by God I was going to have a level transition in there after what I'd been through.</p>
            <p>And that's <strong>Don't Get Wet!</strong> - a good starter project for this engine, a nice chance to incorporate my own music into a game, and a steep but necessary learning curve to eventually scrabble up.</p>
